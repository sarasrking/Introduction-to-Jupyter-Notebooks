## Let's learn to use markdown

Using the workshop list of commands - saved in the repository as **Worksheet_Python.txt** we can now start with some basic markdown. Remember that [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is how you can make rich (or formatted) text in a plain text editor.

- First let's splash around in markdown!
  - Markdown is for writing down comments outside of the code cells, so you can describe what you are doing as you go.
  - In computer programming a 'string' is sequence of alphanumerical characters
  - Type **# this is a string** into the cell, making sure you select 'Markdown' from the dropdown menu above where it shows 'Code' as the default. Already here you can see how notebooks are flexible, as you can choose what kind of cell you are writing in (and toggle it at any time!)

  - Click on 'Run' or use the shortcut **Shift+Enter** to execute the cell. 
  - You have just created a heading in your notebook! Hooray!

  - Now let's try italics. In a new cell type **_this is a string_**, and select 'Markdown' from the dropdown menu again.
  - Click on 'Run' or use the  shortcut **Shift+Enter** to execute the cell.
  - Voila! _Italics!_

### Activity

Following the same instructions as above, try typing these: 

  -**print ("this is a string")**
    
  -**print ("\"this is a string\"")**
    
What happens? What is going on here? Speak in small groups about these instructions, markdown and what you've just learned. It can feel a little strange, as you already know how to do this in programs like Word, but what we are doing here is shorthand, and 'speaking' directly to the computer, with a different kind of interface.

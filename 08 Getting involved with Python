Teaching: 15
Exercises: 1
Question:
- How do you use a dictionary in Python?
Objectives:
- Use Python to print keys and values from a dictionay
Activity:
 - Use a dictionary in Python
Keypoints:
 - Remember that programming is about language as much as maths - you _can_ talk to a computer and it will understand if you know the language!

## Ready to splash a little with Python?

  - In a new cell, select 'code'. Remember that the code cell looks different to the markdown cell. _How can you tell?_ 
  
    Type the following inside the cell:
    
      **d = {'employee': 'Juanita Lopez','salary':81000, 'startdate': '2010-11-1'}**
      **e = {'employee': 'Peter Gynn','salary':83400, 'startdate': '2008-3-25'}**
      **f = {'employee': 'Jolie Talofa','salary':96800, 'startdate': '2007-3-14'}**
      **print (d)**
      **print (e)**
      **print (f)**

So what is going on here?

The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to groups of variables. This creates a kind of shorthand for working on these variables later.

[NEED MORE EXPLANATION ABOUT WHAT THIS IS USEFUL FOR]

[MIGHT NEED AN ACTIVITY HERE TO PRACTICE WHAT WE JUST DID ABOVE?]

Now we are going to construct a _data frame_

Type the following into a new cell:

  **employee <- c("Juanita Lopez", "Peter Gynn", "Jolie Talofa")**
  **salary <- c(81000, 83400, 96800)**
  **startdate <- as.Date(c("2010-11-1", "2008-3-25", "2007-3-14"))**
  **employ.data <- data.frame(employee, salary, startdate)**
  **employ.data <- data.frame(employee, salary, startdate, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)**
  **employ.data**
  
Click on 'run' or shift+enter [THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE CODE HERE - LINE 3 'as.Date'

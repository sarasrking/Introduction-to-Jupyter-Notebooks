## Ready to splash a little with Python?

  - In a new cell, select 'code'. Remember that the code cell looks different to the markdown cell. _How can you tell?_ 
  
    Type the following inside the cell:
    
      **d = {'employee': 'Juanita Lopez','salary':81000, 'startdate': '2010-11-1'}**
      **e = {'employee': 'Peter Gynn','salary':83400, 'startdate': '2008-3-25'}**
      **f = {'employee': 'Jolie Talofa','salary':96800, 'startdate': '2007-3-14'}**
      **print (d)**
      **print (e)**
      **print (f)**

So what is going on here?

The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.

Question:
- How do we create an array?
Objectives:
- Understand what an array is and how it might be helpful
Activity:
 - Create your own array
Keypoints:
 - Using arrays helps create solutions which allow to apply an operation to an entire set of values at once. Efficiency FTW!

## Paddling with Python

In this section we are going to create an *array*. An *array* is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (called values or variables), with each identified by at least one key (or array index).

### Print an array

  - In your 'code' cell, write the following series of commands:

    - **arr = ["Jack", "Queen", "King"]**
    - **print(arr[0])**
    - **print(arr[1])**
    - **print(arr[2])**

  - Click on 'Run' or use the shortcut **Shift+Enter** to execute the cell.

  - You have now printed an array. What you can see is that you have assigned each word a number (or a key, or        array index). 
  - Now let's see what happens if we change something:
  
  *[NEED SOMETHING HERE TO SHOW THE POINT OF AN ARRAY I THINK]*
  
  
  ## Mini-activity

Take a few minutes to create your own array, with 10 or more variables. Apply some changes to the code to see how you can interact with it. How could this be useful to you and or others in your area?
